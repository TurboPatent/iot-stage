In devices implementing IEEE 802 standards, the MAC provides a control abstraction of the physical layer such that the complexities of physical link control are invisible to the LLC and upper layers of the network stack. Thus any LLC block (and higher layers) may be used with any MAC. In turn, the MAC is formally connected to the PHY via a media-independent interface. The MAC is typically integrated with the PHY within the same device package, although in theory any MAC may be used with any PHY, independent of the transmission medium."
